# 🦈 Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis Lab

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates hands-on experience capturing, analyzing, and interpreting real network traffic using Wireshark. The lab focuses on understanding how modern web traffic flows across a network, how packets are structured, and how encryption protects data in transit.

This project reflects real-world SOC and cybersecurity analyst workflows rather than simulated or academic exercises.
